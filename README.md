# [MLA Labs' no-nonsense audio playground](https://playground.mlalabs.xyz/)

## What is it?

It's just that, a simple and intuitive playground for sound processing that runs directly on the browser. Choose any input deviceâ€”your microphone, a synth, or even a noisy fanâ€”and run it through the playgroundâ€™s effects. Or, if youâ€™re feeling adventurous, upload any file (yes, even an image or text file!) in the File tab and explore how it sounds when looped, detuned, or warped with different playback rates.

Need inspiration? Log in with FreeSound and dive into their massive collection of samplesâ€”you might stumble upon the perfect starting point!

With a variety of effects at your fingertips, tweak, twist, and shape the sound in real-time. Once youâ€™ve crafted something unique, try recording it! You can then download your creation or reintroduce it as an input to push your experiment even further.

No rules, just sonic explorationâ€”letâ€™s see what you can create! ðŸš€ðŸ”Š
